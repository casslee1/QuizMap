Welcome! QuizMap is an online trivia game where players answer questions by finding a location on a map.

# Description
QuizMap takes the online trivia game a step further, once you figure out what the answer is you also have to find where it is. Players are presented with four trivia questions per day. Currently the game has one weeks worth of questions. Full instructions for game play are provided in the game by clicking on the ‘Help’ button. Players’ results are tracked and are accessible through a ‘Stats’ button.

# Motivation
I enjoy daily, limited play games and maps and came up with a fun way to put the two together.

# Designed and Built With
React, CSS, React Leaflet, Material UI, Figma
